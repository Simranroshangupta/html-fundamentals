    <h1>HTML Introduction</h1>

    <h2>HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language</h2>

    <p>
        HTML is used for developing the structure or format of a web page
        which is displayed in the browser.
    </p>

    <p>
        HTML uses tags that are opened and closed using their tag names.
        The most important tag is the <strong>html</strong> tag, which opens first
        and closes last. The <strong>DOCTYPE html</strong> declaration has no closing tag
        and is used to specify the HTML version being used.
    </p>

    <p>
        The <strong>head</strong> tag is used to define metadata of the web page.
        It can include the title, external links, CSS, and JavaScript files.
    </p>

    <p>
        There is a difference between the <strong>head</strong> tag and headings.
        The head tag contains information about the page, whereas headings are
        used to display content on the web page. HTML provides six heading levels,
        from h1 to h6.
    </p>

    <h2>Heading Levels</h2>

    <h1>h1 - Biggest Heading</h1>
    <h2>h2 - Second Level Heading</h2>
    <h3>h3 - Third Level Heading</h3>
    <h4>h4 - Fourth Level Heading</h4>
    <h5>h5 - Fifth Level Heading</h5>
    <h6>h6 - Smallest Heading</h6>
